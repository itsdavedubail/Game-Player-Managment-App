# Game-Player-Managment-App

#Your client, The Gaming Room, currently has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android systems. They would like to expand it to other operating platforms. To do so, you have been asked to create a simulated environment that demonstrates prototypes to present multiple platform options to your client.

In this assignment, you will develop components of an application so it may be deployed on various operating platforms using the client-server architectural pattern. You will use Basic Authentication to build a username and password login interface by modifying the provided tutorial code. Primarily, you will be working on the server-side component of the application to gain experience with developing using a REST Application Programming Interface (API).
